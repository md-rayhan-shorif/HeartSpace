# HeartSpace
HeartSpace is a private, mood-centric web application designed to help you share heartfelt messages, memories, and photos with a partner or loved one. Unlike traditional blogs, HeartSpace prioritizes emotional context by dynamically adapting its entire interface to the "mood" of each post.
